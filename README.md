# 🏦 Bank Customer Churn Prediction – End-to-End ML Project
## 📌 Project Overview

Customer churn is a major challenge in the banking industry, leading to revenue loss and increased customer acquisition costs.
This project builds an end-to-end machine learning pipeline to predict whether a bank customer is likely to churn, and deploys the final model using an interactive Streamlit application.

The solution combines data analysis, feature engineering, model experimentation, evaluation using ROC-AUC, and a production-style dashboard for exploration and prediction.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Analyze customer behavior and identify churn patterns
- Perform robust feature engineering and model experimentation
- Select the best-performing model based on ROC-AUC
- Deploy the model via a user-friendly Streamlit web app
- Present insights in a business-interpretable manner

## 🧠 Machine Learning Workflow

All modeling and experimentation are implemented in a separate notebook/script included in this repository.

1. Data Understanding & Cleaning

- Removed non-informative identifiers (RowNumber, CustomerId, Surname)
- Checked missing values and data consistency
- Treated categorical and numerical features appropriately

2. Feature Engineering

- Encoding categorical variables (Gender, Geography)
- Binary transformation of behavioral indicators:
  - Active Member
  - Complaints
- Feature scaling where required
- Target variable: Exited (0 = Retained, 1 = Churned)

3. Model Experimentation<br/>
Multiple classification models were trained and evaluated:
      - Random Forest
      - XGBoost
      - Decision Tree

4. Model Evaluation & Selection
- Primary evaluation metric: ROC-AUC
- Cross-validated performance comparison
- Final model selected based on:
  - Highest ROC-AUC
  - Stability and generalization performance

The selected model is then serialized and used in the Streamlit application.

## 🖥️ Streamlit Application

The Streamlit app consists of three focused pages, each serving a specific purpose.

### 1️⃣ Intro Page
- Business context of customer churn
- Overview of the ML solution
- Explanation of how predictions can support retention strategies

### 2️⃣ Dashboard Page
- Interactive exploratory analysis using Plotly visualizations:
  - Age vs Churn
  - Gender vs Churn
  - Geography vs Churn
  - Tenure vs Churn
  - Active Member vs Churn
  - Complaints vs Churn
  - Number of Products vs Churn
  - Balance Distribution

This page helps stakeholders understand key churn drivers.

### 3️⃣ Prediction Page
- Displays a preview of the training dataset
- Accepts real-time customer inputs:
  - Age
  - Gender
  - Geography
  - Tenure
  - Active Member
  - Complaints
  - Number of Products
  - Account Balance
- Predicts:
 Churn risk classification (High / Low)
- Designed with business-friendly output for decision-making
