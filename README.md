# 🏦 Bank Customer Churn Prediction – End-to-End ML Project
## 📌 Project Overview

Customer churn is a major challenge in the banking industry, leading to revenue loss and increased customer acquisition costs.
This project builds an end-to-end machine learning pipeline to predict whether a bank customer is likely to churn, and deploys the final model using an interactive Streamlit application.

The solution combines data analysis, feature engineering, model experimentation, evaluation using ROC-AUC, and a production-style dashboard for exploration and prediction.
